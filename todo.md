# Todo
- [ ] Don't reload all the project resources when picking images in the project editor
- [ ] Allow zooming/panning the image preview in the tileset editor
- [ ] Figure out how to get TypeScript to realize that `window.require` exists and is a real function (alternatively, figure out how to use electron/jimp without `window.require`)
